# makeMeBetter
simple example of a project that needs help

## A bit about the project
This is a very simple Node, Angular and Bootstrap web app. All it has is a very simple login page that logs you into the Profile of the User

*Note: There is no database this is just a mock user in memory *

To log in use:
* email 123@123.123
* password 123123

## To get started
To get the project going you will need NPM and NodeJs installed. once that is complete run the following from the project folder
````
> npm install
> npm start
````

## What to change
There are several area's of this project that are either missing or just done wrong. Some are subtle and some are obvious. This is by design. 

So this is what I would like you to do

1. After you login you see an ugly Profile UI. Fix it to look better 
2. Code Review the project: Go through the entire project (even your new feature) and compile a list of changes you would make to the entire project that would make it
  - More Secure
  - Perform Better
  - Better Architecture
  - Better User Experiance
  - Better Design
Make sure your change list is clear. Mention which file, which line when applicable. Explain how you would change it in a sentence or two
3. Implement as many of your suggestions as possible
