Recomendations:
This is a list of recommendations to make this project better 
(UI, UX, Performance, Security, Architecture, Bug fix, New Feature, ...etc )

// Please make your recommendations as clear as possible with only a few sentences 

1. I would have preferred it if it was used React js.

* for security:
1. add email and password validation for front and back end.
2. hashing password and add salt - using jws or passport js.
3. add a protected route to avoid the unvalidated user to go to user profile using stored token.
4. send the token with the response for the client and store it using Cookies or local storage.
5. the password should not be sent to user.
6. send one message for wrong password or email "wrong password or email".
7. When changing the password, the old password must be requested.

* for UI/UX ;
1. add navbar for user page.
2. add button to logout.
3. make profile image smaller and add ability to change it.
4. add home page with routes.
5. Choose a brief and proper message and send it to the user in case of error.


* for Performance and Architecture:
1. separate the HTML pages for all purposes.
2. add styles folder and files.
3. minimize profile image size before store it in database.
4. check the empty input should be in front end before sending the info to server.
5. add Async/await for API's requests.

*New Feature:
1. add Register link in home page and log in page.
